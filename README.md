# ZimmersModelicaTutorial
A Modelica library offering a 11 steps tutorial for beginners focussing on graphical modelling capabilites.

## Library description
This tutorial consists of 11 steps. Starting from simple free bodies, continuing with chaotic systems like a double pendulum and then containing the model of an inverse pendulum with position control.

In addition to models from the [Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica), the library uses simple planar mechanical components that are directly contained in this tutorial.
